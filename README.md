#### [Week-by-week deliverables and requirements]()

## What is this Course?
Connective Media is the study of the artifacts, technologies, processes and ecosystems that are involved in the recent convergence of communication, information, and media. Connective Media is changing the way that we behave as a society: the way we act, the way we get information, the way we diffuse information, the way we shape our views and our culture. To innovate and excel in this landscape, students need skills and knowledge from technology, the social sciences, business, and design. 

This course will cover the cognitive, behavioral and social science background that is paramount to understanding the connective media landscape.

## Class Objectives

This course, the core course in the Connective Media Human and Social track, explores the behavioral foundations of communication technology and the information sciences. The course focuses on the theories from the behavioral sciences that play a role in understanding people’s use of, access to and interactions with information and communication technologies. The course will examine multiple levels of analysis – individual, social, and collectives – and present multiple disciplinary perspectives. The course has three primary goals:

*	Provide an introduction to social science theories and approaches to understanding the use of current information technologies, to identify needs that are not currently being met, and to inform the design of future IT. 
*	Familiarize the students with the interdisciplinary literature relevant to understanding the connective media landscape.
*	Expose students to knowledge and language from a variety of scholarly domains.
*	Introduce students to ideas, as well as styles of research and writing in the social sciences, with a focus on being able to understand research reports, at least at a basic level.

## Class Requirements

### Readings

The reading materials, mostly papers and book chapters, are listed below. All the readings are required, and you will be asked submit an online response to the reading every week before class. You may be asked, for example, to reason about each reading, provide critique and extensions, and comment about its significance in the context of connective media technology. Each paper or chapter counts as one reading. Your lowest three reading reflection grades will not be counted (i.e. three papers throughout) these three grades may include submissions that you missed (no questions asked). Late submissions will be treated as missing. 

### Presentations

In randomly-assigned teams of two, each student will take part in two class presentations, each about one of the class readings. Your two presentations will be on different weeks. Each presentation will summarize the research, highlight related work, and discuss the implications for technology and connective media. Exact instructions and guidelines [are below](#presreq). 

### Assignment: Replication

The only major assignment is a Replication experiment, where you will be replicating a behavioral/social science experiment of your choice. Details forthcoming, but start thinking about experiments you'd like to run! This assignment is performed in groups of 2 or 3. 

### Attendance

You may miss up to one class without notice, but no more than two absences are acceptable, even with excuse. In any case, please do let me know if you happen to miss a class session, either in advance or retroactively.  

### Participation

Class participation is part of the grade, and is function of the quantity and quality of your class discussion. Not being able to discuss the readings in class will cost you participation points. 

### Exams

There are no exams. 

## Grades 

Your grade breakdown (G for Group grade): 
30% Class presentation (G)
25% Reading and service responses
20% Participation
25% Replication assignment (G)

Note: the average grade in this class is likely to be a B or B+. You will need to really stand out to get an A. 

M.Eng and MBA students may take the class for a grade or pass-fail with prior approval. All the requirements for class would still stand. To get a passing grade, a student would need a C and above grade for each of the class components. 

## Key Threads

- **Individual** - key elements in CM product design.
- **Social** - Key product aspects that drive the CM business.
- **Social Systems** - Key technologies that are used in CM systems.

## Class Presentations

<a name="presreq">
### Requirements and procedures </a>

Class presentations will be assigned by the instructor, based on student preferences. 

The basic presentations should be 15 minutes long, strictly enforced, but the presenters should lead an additional 10-15 minutes of discussion. The initial presentation should briefly touch on:
-   The main design decisions made by the different applications/services
-   How these decisions impact the service in different ways, including: types of usage, nature of content, retention, patterns of consumption etc.

The presenters will use examples and screenshots from the services they compare, and for extra credit, identify and discuss additional scholarly articles that are related to the service types. These articles could be a) describing a related theory, or b) studying and providing insights about the services or other related platforms and systems. I will be available to provide some pointers and directions as needed; you will need to approach me by Sunday before your presentation, at the latest, to get help.

The presentation and discussion after may also refer to past/future trends for this category. What's next for these types of services? Bonus points for original ways to lead or encourage discussion and participation! 

Your presentation grade will be based on the quality and clarity of your presentation and the discussion.
