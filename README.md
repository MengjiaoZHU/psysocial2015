## What is this Course?
Connective Media is the study of the artifacts, technologies, processes and ecosystems that are involved in the recent convergence of communication, information, and media. Connective Media is changing the way that we behave as a society: the way we act, the way we get information, the way we diffuse information, the way we shape our views and our culture. To innovate and excel in this landscape, students need skills and knowledge from technology, the social sciences, business, and design.

This course, the core course in the Connective Media Human and Social track, explores the psychological and sociological foundations of communication technology and the information sciences. The course focuses on the theories from the cognitive, behavioral and social sciences that play a role in understanding people’s use of, access to and interactions with information and communication technologies. The course will examine multiple levels of analysis – individual, social, and collectives – and present multiple disciplinary perspectives. The course has three primary goals:

* Provide an introduction to theories and approaches to understanding the use of current information technologies, to identify needs that are not currently being met, and to inform the design of future IT.
* Familiarize the students with the interdisciplinary literature relevant to understanding the connective media landscape.
* Expose students to knowledge and language from a variety of scholarly domains.
* Introduce students to ideas, as well as styles of research and writing in psychology, sociology and other relevant fields of science, with a focus on being able to understand research reports, at least at a basic level.

### Key Threads
- **Individual** - Cognitive and behavioral science approaches to attention, perception, reasoning and decision-making.
- **Social** - Social-psychological approaches to motivation, language and identity.
- **Social Systems** - Behavioral and sociological approaches to social systems including groups, social ties, and social networks.

## Class Requirements

### Readings

The reading materials, mostly papers and book chapters, are listed below. All the readings are required, and you will be asked submit an online response to the reading every week before class. You may be asked, for example, to reason about each reading, provide critique and extensions, and comment about its significance in the context of connective media technology. Each paper or chapter counts as one reading. Your lowest three reading reflection grades will not be counted (i.e. three papers throughout) these three grades may include submissions that you missed (no questions asked). Late submissions will be treated as missing. 

### Presentations

In randomly-assigned teams of two, each student will take part in two class presentations, each about one of the class readings. Your two presentations will be on different weeks. Each presentation will summarize the research, highlight related work, and discuss the implications for technology and connective media. Exact instructions and guidelines [are below](#presreq). 

### Assignment: Replication

[Assignment Requirement Link](https://github.com/cornelltech/psysocial2015/wiki/Replication-Assignment)

The only major assignment is a Replication experiment, where you will be replicating a behavioral/social science experiment of your choice. Details forthcoming, but start thinking about experiments you'd like to run! This assignment is performed in groups of 2 or 3. 

### Attendance

You may miss up to one class without notice, but no more than two absences are acceptable, even with excuse. In any case, please do let me know if you happen to miss a class session, either in advance or retroactively.  

### Participation

Class participation is part of the grade, and is function of the quantity and quality of your class discussion. Not being able to discuss the readings in class will cost you participation points. 

### Exams

There are no exams. Yay!

## Grades 

Your grade breakdown (G for Group grade): 
30% Class presentation (G)
25% Reading and service responses
20% Participation
25% Replication assignment (G)

Note: the average grade in this class is likely to be a B or B+. You will need to really stand out to get an A. 

M.Eng and MBA students may take the class for a grade or pass-fail with prior approval. All the requirements for class would still stand. To get a passing grade, a student would need a C and above grade for each of the class components. 

## Class Presentations

<a name="presreq">
### Requirements and procedures </a>

Class presentations will be assigned by the teaching team. 

The basic presentations should be 15 minutes long, strictly enforced, but the presenters should *lead an additional 10-15 minutes of discussion*. The initial presentation should briefly touch on:
*	The main theory/argument of the article/reading
*	The methods used to support the argument
*	The implications of the article for connective media technologies.

The presenter will also identify and discuss additional scholarly articles that are related to the reading. These articles could be a) describing a related theory, or b) offering a critique of the original article, or c) showing how the theory presented in the article is used in a technical system. The teaching team will be available to provide some pointers and directions as needed; you will need to approach us by the Friday before your presentation, at the latest, to get assistance.
The discussion you lead could be woven into your presentation. Bonus points for original ways to lead or encourage discussion and participation! 

While the presentations are done in pairs, each presentation should be 100% coherent and consistent. In other words, presentations that are clearly based on "split work" where each partner is respobsible for her/his own part are unacceptable. Work together to create a flowing, coherent and meaningful presentation! 

Your presentation grade will be based on the quality and clarity of your presentation and the discussion.
